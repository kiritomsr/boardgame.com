**Risk Assessment:** 

Risk assessment and management are essential components of software development projects, as they help anticipate potential issues that could affect the project's success. In this section, we highlight the potential technical risks that may face us while developing the system, assess them in terms of their probability of occurrence and impact, and present our strategies to mitigate them. The section is divided into three sections: The first focuses on listing and describing the technical risks that may affect the timeline of the project and provides strategies to mitigate them. The second presents the risk assessment matrix that was used to assign priority levels for each risk. The third lists general risks that apply to the use of the management system after deployment of the product.

2. **Risk Matrix and Assessment:** 

We used the risk matrix to assign a priority level for each risk based on its likelihood to occur and its potential impact as shown in figure the figure below. The cells in the matrix are color-coded to indicate the level of risk associated with each combination of probability and impact. The cells in the upper right-hand corner are highlighted in dark red (Critical Level) because they represent risks that are both highly likely to occur and have a significant impact on the project. The cells in the lower right-hand corner are highlighted in light red (High Level) because they represent tasks that, although less likely to occur, can cause major disruptions to the schedule when they do. The cells in the upper left side of the matrix are highlighted in yellow because although they are likely to occur, their impact will not cause major issues to the schedule. The cells in the lower left-hand corner of the matrix are highlighted in green to indicate the lowest level of risk because they represent risks that are less likely to occur and have a lower impact on the schedule.

3. **General risks that apply to the use of the system after deployment:** 

- Intellectual property risks by using FAQs, errata docs: The system may use content that is protected by intellectual property rights, such as copyright and trademark. To mitigate the risk, we will either obtain the necessary permissions and licenses to use the content before deployment or refrain from using such resources. The stakeholders will be informed about the importance of monitoring the content uploaded by players and a feature for reporting unlicensed content may be provided in future releases. 

- Privacy/ Confidentiality risks: The system may collect personal information from users, such as their name, address, and payment details. We will ensure that the system protects the privacy of users using a proper encryption mechanism and by giving users the control over what information to display on their profiles. We will also avoid storing the exact location of users and restrict the functionality to specifying the city and country. Initially, this information will not be even collected from users upon registration, but it can be added in the accountâ€™s information page where it is the duty of the user to choose whether to add the information or not as well as setting their preferred display permissions.
