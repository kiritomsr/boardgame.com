Tabletop games have experienced a significant surge in popularity over the past two decades, leading to the emergence of a vast social network of players and enthusiasts worldwide. These games, comprising board games, miniature war games, card games, and role-playing games, have become a significant cultural phenomenon, with numerous shops and online communities dedicated to promoting and supporting them. However, for players, managing a personal collection of tabletop games can be a challenging task. According to a survey we conducted, most players rely on their memory when it comes to managing tabletop games which may lead to forgetting about owning a game, let alone playing it. For those who use online systems, many of them do not check their collections regularly because of the complexity of the systems offering the service, which requires a substantial investment of time and effort on the part of the players to complete any task. In this document, we outline our plan for implementing a system for managing personal tabletop games collections that cater to playersâ€™ needs with minimal effort to achieve tasks.
