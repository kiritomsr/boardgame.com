In this Usability Test Analysis report, we present our findings and recommendations based on the results of a usability test conducted on our website. As outlined in our Usability Test Plan, our objective was to evaluate the website's user experience and identify areas for improvement. However, due to limited resources in terms of time and the number of users, we conducted the test with only two participants. To capture users' interactions and responses during the test, we used [Userbrain](https://www.userbrain.com/en/?free-trial=1&utm_source=aw-UK-CPA&campaignid=17998962463&adgroupid=146736995504&adid=615704518236&gclid=CjwKCAjw__ihBhADEiwAXEazJtf0l15nWlMVYuo8omfNR72RyX0kh8vpXAGRBalZPxjRGBVGDVGNqRoCR54QAvD_BwE) to conduct the test through screen recordings and feedback collection.
The raw data collected during the usability test, including participant responses, screen recordings, and notes, can be found in the [UsabilityTest](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/tree/main/Testing/Usability%20Test/Raw%20Data) directory. This report presents a summary of the feedback from our two users, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the website, and offering suggestions for enhancements based on the identified issues.
