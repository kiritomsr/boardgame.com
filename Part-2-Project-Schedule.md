**Project Schedule:** 

This section outlines the project plan by breaking it down into tasks and visualizing them through a ‘Gantt chart’. The chart shows the project’s activities from when it officially began up to the estimated delivery date. Each task is depicted as a horizontal bar, with the length of the bar indicating the expected duration of the task in days. When a task is completed, it is set to a 100% completion status and its color is darkened. “Finish to Start” dependencies between tasks are illustrated using lines, which indicate that a successor task cannot start unless its predecessor has finished. The chart also includes milestones shown as diamond-shaped icons signifying a deliverable in the project timeline. We chose the Gantt Chart as it would help us identify potential scheduling conflicts, ensure that tasks are completed in the correct order, and get a clear overview of the project’s progress at any time. The project is expected to run for 108 days with a total of 192 working hours, focusing purely on the user's interface as well as the requirements outlined in the requirements section. Our Gantt Chart is shown below.

The pre-development stage was successfully completed on time, but it is expected that there will be changes to the ‘Database design’ and the ‘UI design’ as outlined in the ‘Risk Assessment’ section. The project's development phase contains several critical tasks that may affect the project timeline if delayed. First and foremost, the implementation of the database could have severely impacted the implementation of all the modules as they all depend on reading from and/or writing to the database. However, the task was completed successfully, and the ‘Development’ stage started on its expected date. Secondly, the ‘Account’ and ‘Profile’ pages are introduced at the beginning of the ‘Implementation’ phase as it is unlikely for there would be significant changes to these modules based on prior feedback from users. Additionally, these modules are essential for the development of other modules, such as the ‘Community’ and the ‘Forum’. Next on the list of critical tasks is the implementation of the ‘Game’ and ‘Collection’ modules, as they represent the heart of the system. Therefore, it was necessary to allocate more time to the implementation of these modules in specific, especially since future feedback from users may include new features to be considered. Some tasks such as the implementation of the ‘Community’ and ‘Market’ modules, although critical to the completion of the project, were given less time as some visual/behavioral aspects were reused from other modules. Other critical tasks, such as the ‘Forum’ and the module that displays the ‘Friends’/‘Followers’/‘Follows’, are given more time for completion as they have unique visuals and behaviors compared to other modules.  

 

Generally, each developer is expected to put in a maximum of 2 hours per day to work on the project as they all have additional commitments to other university projects. If there were to be a delay in any implementation tasks, the developers assigned to it can utilize the lag day between the end of one module and the beginning of the next to compensate for said delays. For tasks requiring more effort, the tester may participate in the implementation to avoid significant delays. In extreme cases, developers may have to work over the allotted work hours to compensate. The post-development stage includes tasks to finish the project, such as ‘User Acceptance Testing’, ‘Deployment’, and a ‘Post-Implementation Review’ to identify the lessons learned from the project and document the strengths and weaknesses of the project.
