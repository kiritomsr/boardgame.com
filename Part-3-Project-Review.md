The project review was conducted on April 18, 2023. The review started by revising the first document that outlined the project objectives, user requirements and UI and system design, then reviewing the project's timeline, and finally, risks that occurred and how they were mitigated compared to the original risk mitigation strategies. 

Unfortunately, due to unavoidable circumstances, the team had to work as a group of three because the fourth member has withdrawn from the organization. The time was critical as the team was in the implementation phase and contributions of the fourth member included preparing the database and queries to be used in the backend development stage.  Combined with pressure of other projects, the work did not progress as expected and the timeline was almost completely different. As a result, the focus shifted from realizing all the ‘must have’ requirements to implementing the core features that are realizable within the limited timeframe for the first release. Although initially, the team anticipated to conduct tests in parallel with the implementation of features, the team had to delay the test as the tester had to step in to help the backend developer with the implementation of the database and core functionality. 

**Alignment of expected and actual outcomes:**

Overall, we did not deviate from the [System objectives](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/wikis/Part-1-Report#13-system-objectives) highlighted previously. In particular, the first iteration was aligned with objectives 2, 3, and 4. In the upcoming iterations, realizing more functionality would lead to adhering to all objectives. 

**Implemented functionality:**

At the end of the first iteration, the team could only implement requirements [1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 8.1](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/wikis/Part-1-Report#22-functional-requirements)  and partially implemented requirements [1.4, 6.2](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/wikis/Part-1-Report#22-functional-requirements), and [13.1](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/wikis/Part-1-Report#22-functional-requirements) which mostly focused on view functions. In upcoming iterations, other functionality that focuses on adding, updating and removing items will be realized.   

**Alignment of the implemented UI and system design with the wireframe and initial system design:**

The team followed the same layout introduced in the wireframe with minimal deviation but the choice of some icons proved to be confusing during the usability test. Additionally, the team followed the same design introduced in the outlined system design section with some variation in the database implementation as opposed to the initial design but the change of the UI and database design was an anticipated risk and the team handled it as suggested in the [risk assessment section](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/wikis/Part-2-Risk-Assessment-and-Management) by accepting the risk and controlling it. 

**Risk assessment and management:**

When a risk occurs, the team handled it as strategize in the [risk assessment](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sdoc2223/Morgan_Group/-/wikis/Part-2-Risk-Assessment-and-Management) highlighted previously. This includes:

1. Complex/Unrealizable functionality like password hashing: 

The team handled it as strategized by accepting the challenge and admitting the need for more time to realize it by deferring the functionality to the upcoming iterations. 

2. Underestimating time required to accomplish tasks which was magnified by losing a team member:
The team handled it as strategized by having other members stepping in to work in the implementation and working overtime to push as many features as possible. 

Though some risks such as feature creep did not occur explicitly during the first iteration but it could have occurred if more features were implemented and more usability tests were conducted. Some risks were eliminated such as merge conflict because the members communicated clearly and scheduled merges properly.  


**Strengths:**

1. The team displayed resilience when faced with unforeseeable events, maintaining a positive attitude and avoiding blame games.

2. The team was able to adapt and learn new skills or enhance existing ones, both in terms of soft skills (e.g., working under pressure) and technical skills (e.g., adapting to new development environments).

3. The team could effectively prioritize tasks based on their contribution to the project outcomes, such as focusing on usability and automated tests over intensive walkthroughs and unit tests when time was limited.

**Weaknesses:**

1. The team did not anticipate the risk of losing a member and did not have a plan in place to handle such a situation.

2.  The team underestimated the scope of the project, which led to a failure to implement most of the core functionalities expected in the first iteration.

3. The team overestimated their skills in relation to the project's timeframe, which contributed to the inability to complete all the expected tasks.

4. Due to limited human resources, unit and integration tests were not conducted, leading to undiscovered issues or bugs.

**Opportunities for improvements:**

In any project, there is a room for improvement and for this project, there is a wide one, whether in next iterations or future projects as highlighted:

1. The team should improve their risk management skills by identifying potential risks, such as the withdrawal of a team member, and developing a plan to address such risk.

2. The team should reevaluate the project scope and timeline to develop a more realistic and achievable plan, considering the skills and resources available. 
3. The team should assess the resources required for the project, including human resources and technical skills, to ensure that the team can efficiently complete tasks within the given timeline.

4. The members should improve communication and collaboration among team members to ensure that everyone is aware of project updates, challenges, and progress. Unfortunately, the fourth member was absent for some time before the deadline of the first iteration but the members did not know about the situation until later.  

5. The members should improve communication with stakeholders by publicizing issues more often.
